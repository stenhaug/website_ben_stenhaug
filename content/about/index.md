I majored in statistics, economics, and mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Following college, I nearly entered a PhD program in economics but seeking the uncomfortable joined Teach for America and served as a high school math teacher in Eastern North Carolina instead.

I then worked for nearly 3 years at Khan Academy on math content (everything from middle school to AP Statistics and AP Calculus) that is still used by millions of students worldwide.

Motivated by the possibility of leveraging the explosion of education data gathered by organizations like Khan Academy, I joined the Stanford Graduate School of Education as a PhD student in 2016. I think about measuring test bias and data science for education and social good.

Along the way, I've received an extraordinary data science education thanks to Stanford's Master's Program in Statistics and the [**Stanford Data Lab**](https://datalab.stanford.edu/) in particular. I'm also a [**2018 Data Science For Social Good fellow**](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/). As a result, I've become fascinated with teaching data science (and R in particular).

I write on [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@benastenhaug) sometimes and have a podcast with friends called [**Ben, Ben, and Blue**](https://www.benbenandblue.com/). If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out to me at *benastenhaug@gmail.com*.
