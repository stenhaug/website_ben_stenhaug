I majored in statistics, economics, and mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Following college, I taught high school math at Warren Early College High School in Warrenton, North Carolina as part of Teach for America.

I then worked for nearly 3 years at Khan Academy on the math content team. We developed content—everything from middle school to AP Calculus—that is still used by millions of students worldwide.

Motivated by the possibility of leveraging the explosion of educational data gathered by organizations like Khan Academy, I joined the Stanford Graduate School of Education as a PhD student in 2016. My research focuses on measuring learning, identifying biased assessments, and comparing psychometric models. 

I am currently working on my dissertation and working with the Stanford Data Science Institute to design the future of data science research and education at Stanford. In particular, I lead the [**Data Science for Social Good Program**](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program).

Along the way, I've received an extraordinary data science education thanks to Stanford's Master's Program in Statistics and the [**Stanford Data Lab**](https://datalab.stanford.edu/) in particular. I'm also a [**2018 Data Science For Social Good fellow**](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/). As a result, I've become fascinated by the way data science teams are organized, adapt, and learn while tackling complicated problems.
