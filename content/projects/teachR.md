### Background

After completing the [**Stanford Data Challenge Lab**](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/06/students-confront-messiness-data/?linkId=52678230), I started to think about how I would teach R. To that end, I began making YouTube videos, writing articles, and designing exercises. This curriculum is unfinished for now but I plan to return to it in the future.

If you only look at one piece of content, check out the [**5 verbs of dplyr exercise**](https://github.com/stenhaug/teachR/blob/master/content/the-5-verbs-of-dplyr/the-5-verbs-of-dplyr-exercise.md).
