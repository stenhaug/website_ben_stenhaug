      <description>See the package website.
Background In my work, I often need to run a function in R many times (for example in running a simulation). If any of these runs throw an error, all progress is lost. The tidyverse package purrrr provides functionality like safely which helps but makes subsequent analysis tricky. As a remedy, I wrote the package purrrplus which allows for running a function safely with easy analysis of errors and results.</description>

      <description>I majored in statistics, economics, and mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Following college, I nearly entered a PhD program in economics but instead joined Teach for America and served as a high school math teacher in Eastern North Carolina.
I then worked for nearly 3 years at Khan Academy on math content (everything from middle school to AP Statistics and AP Calculus) that is still used by millions of students worldwide.</description>

      <description>You can find the curriculum here.
Background After completing the Stanford Data Challenge Lab, I started to think about how I would teach R. To that end, I began making YouTube videos, writing articles, and designing exercises. This curriculum is unfinished for now but I plan to return to it in the future.
