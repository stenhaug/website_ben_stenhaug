      <description>See the package website.
Background In my work, I often need to run a function in R many times (for example in running a simulation). If any of these runs throw an error, all progress is lost. The tidyverse package purrrr provides functionality like safely which helps but makes subsequent analysis tricky. As a remedy, I wrote the package purrrplus which allows for running a function safely with easy analysis of errors and results.</description>

      <description>Teaching is decision making There’s a moment from teaching high school math in North Carolina that I remember especially vividly. It was an ordinary Thursday afternoon, and I felt exhausted. In the back corner a few girls were off-task, two boys were yelling out, asking to go to the bathroom for the 2nd time in the 50 minute period, the lesson I was teaching for the first time in my life wasn’t working, and my old whiteboard marker was nearly out of ink.</description>
