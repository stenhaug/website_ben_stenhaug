      <description>See the package website.
Background In my work, I often need to run a function in R many times (for example in running a simulation). If any of these runs throw an error, all progress is lost. The tidyverse package purrrr provides functionality like safely which helps but makes subsequent analysis tricky. As a remedy, I wrote the package purrrplus which allows for running a function safely with easy analysis of errors and results.</description>
