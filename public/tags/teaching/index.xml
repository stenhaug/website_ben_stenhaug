      <description>You can find the curriculum here.
Background: After completing the Stanford Data Challenge Lab, I started to think about how I would teach R. To that end, I began making YouTube videos, writing articles, and designing exercises. This curriculum is unfinished for now but I plan to return to it in the future.
If you check out one piece of content, make it be the 5 verbs of dplyr exercise.</description>
